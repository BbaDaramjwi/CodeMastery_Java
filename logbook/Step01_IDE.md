# IDE

> The choice of the right IDE is not only influenced  
by the programming language and professional requirements  
but is also a matter of personal preference.  

Currently, I have decided to use VSC (Visual Studio Code).  

Although VSC is more of a text editor than a full-fledged IDE,  
it allows me to work with multiple languages without being restricted to just one.  

This enables me to focus more specifically on learning concepts and syntax,  
as I only need to familiarize myself with a program and its functionalities once.
