# Setup

Before I can start, some decisions have to be made!

___

## Step01 - Language selection

> I have to learn several languages at the same time, so the language is clear.

- [X] Java (for this repository)

___

## Step02 - Programming tool

> The choice of the right IDE is not only influenced  
by the programming language and professional requirements  
but is also a matter of personal preference.  

Currently, I have decided to use VSC (Visual Studio Code).  

Although VSC is more of a text editor than a full-fledged IDE,  
it allows me to work with multiple languages without being restricted to just one.  

This enables me to focus more specifically on learning concepts and syntax,  
as I only need to familiarize myself with a program and its functionalities once.  

___

## Step03 - Enviroment
I know that I actually have to think about how to separate  
my private data and developer data from each other  
and also how to create an environment for each language in which it has what it needs and only what it needs.  
But I have to skip that topic first.  

___

## Step04 - Filemanagement

> In addition to logic and syntax,  
the management of individual files is essential.  

- [X] Version control
- [X] Online access
- [X] Easy setup on any device

What better choice is there than the combination of Git & GitHub?  
Even knowing that there are cons other options and, I am opting for this combination initially.
